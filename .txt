I can see you're encountering a Prisma migration drift issue. This happens when your database schema doesn't match your migration history. Let me help you fix this.

The error message indicates that Prisma detected differences between your expected schema and the actual database schema. Since this is a development environment, we can safely reset the database and migrations.

Let me first check your current Prisma schema to understand the structure:

Read file: prisma/schema.prisma
Now let me check if there are any existing migrations:

Ran tool
The migrations directory doesn't exist yet, which explains the drift. Let's fix this by resetting the database and creating a fresh migration. Since this is a development environment, we can safely use `prisma migrate reset`:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```
It seems the command completed without output. Let me try running it again to see if there are any issues:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```
Great! The database reset was successful. Now let's create a fresh initial migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
Perfect! The issue has been resolved. Let me verify that the migration was created successfully:

Ran tool
Ran tool
Excellent! The issue has been successfully fixed. Here's what happened and what we did:

## Problem Summary
You encountered a **Prisma migration drift** issue where your database schema was out of sync with your migration history. This commonly happens when:
- Working with an existing database that doesn't have Prisma migrations
- The database schema was modified outside of Prisma
- There's a mismatch between the expected and actual database state

## Solution Applied
1. **Reset the database**: Used `npx prisma migrate reset --force` to clear the existing database and migration history
2. **Created fresh migration**: Used `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` to create a new initial migration based on your current schema

## Current Status
✅ Database is now in sync with your schema  
✅ Initial migration `20250809092552_init` has been created  
✅ Prisma Client has been regenerated  
✅ Your User model with Role enum is properly set up in the database

Your NestJS application should now work correctly with the database. The migration created the `User` table with all the fields defined in your schema, including the `Role` enum and the unique constraint on the `email` field.
